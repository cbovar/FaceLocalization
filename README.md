# FaceLocalization
Face detection using ConvNetSharp


WORK IN PROGRESS

## Face project
Face detection (face / no face).
Download datasets first following [this](https://github.com/cbovar/FaceLocalization/blob/master/src/Dataset/how%20to%20download%20dataset.txt)
 
## Photo 
Choose a photo and the network will try to draw bounding boxes around faces

## Webcam
Display bounding boxes live


The provided network in Photo and Webcam project was trained for ~3 days with Adam optimizer (1e-4f, 0.9f, 0.999f, 1e-16f).
Loss ~ 0.06543
Accuracy ~ 97.65%
